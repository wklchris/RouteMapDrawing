# RouteMapDrawing
[C#] A transit route map drawing soft. This software has some partial customization for @包子曰.

# Features

This drawing soft is a very simple one that can draw a route map of one transit line. Transit line can be a circle or a line, 
but more complex one (like "Y" shape) is NOT supported.  

This soft is made for WeChat account @包子曰, whose owner is my roommate in college. Therefore, this soft will not be updated if he 
doesn't have any further need.
